# Quality trimming and adapter removal
#
# for cutadapt, please fill the fwd and rev fields if required. It can be a
# string, or a filename. If a filename, it must be prefixed with "file:" to
# specify that it is a file and not a string. If the tool is cutadapt, the empty
# fwd and rev fields means that no adapters are to be used.
#
# :Parameters:
#
# - fwd: a string or file (prefixed with *file:*)
# - m: 20 means discard trimmed reads that are shorter than 20.
#         must be > 0
# - quality: 0 means no trimming, 30 means keep base with quality
#        above 30
# - mode: must be set to one of
#     - g for 5'

# Adapter trimming is set by default. Can be disable with -A
# For adapters, this is automatic but you can be specific using 
# --adapter_sequence for read1, and --adapter_sequence_r2 for read2.
# The --cut_tail moves a sliding window from tail (3') to front, drop the bases 
# in the window if its mean quality is below cut_mean_quality, stop otherwise. 
# Use cut_tail_window_size to set the widnow size (default 4)), and

# - tolerance: if strandness is not provided, we will guess it from
#     the data. The metric used is between 0 and 1. It is a ratio between 
#     strand + and -. If below tolerance, the strand is reversely stranded. If
#     above 1-tolerance, it is (forward) stranded. If around 0.5 +- tolerance,
#     it is unstranded. Otherwise, it means our guess would not be very

#     consensus across samples, a warning/error may also be raised. tolerance
#     is therefore in the range [0-0.25]

# bamCoverage write file in bigwig format from BAM files.
# This tool takes an alignment of reads or fragments as input (BAM file) and
# generates a coverage track (bigWig or bedGraph) as output. The coverage is
# calculated as the number of reads per bin, where bins are short consecutive
# counting windows of a defined size. It is possible to extended the length of
# the reads to better reflect the actual fragment length. *bamCoverage* offers
# normalization by scaling factor, Reads Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads
# (RPKM), and 1x depth (reads per genome coverage, RPGC).
#
# :Parameters:
#
# - do: if unchecked, this rule is ignored
# - binSize: Size of the bins, in bases, for the output of the
#            bigwig/bedgraph file. (default: 50)
# - genomeSize: Report read coverage normalized to 1x sequencing depth
#                        (also known as Reads Per Genomic Content (RPGC)).
#                        Sequencing depth is defined as: (total number of
#                        mapped reads * fragment length) / effective genome
#                        size. The scaling factor used is the inverse of the
#                        sequencing depth computed for the sample to match the
#                        1x coverage. To use this option, the effective genome
#                        size has to be indicated after the option. The
#                        effective genome size is the portion of the genome
#                        that is mappable.
# - extendReads: This parameter allows the extension of reads to
#                fragment size.
# - minFragmentLength: The minimum fragment length needed for read/pair
#                      inclusion. Note that a value other than 0 will exclude
#                      all single-end reads.
# - maxFragmentLength: The maximum fragment length needed for read/pair
#                      inclusion. A value of 0 disables filtering and is
#                      needed for including single-end and orphan reads.
